Randi's Bar 

Program description: 

This program retrieves information on drinks from The CocktailDB.com API.  When first arriving at Randi's Bar, the program will ask if the guest has been to Randi's Bar before.  If the guest has been, they will log in to access a list of their previously saved favorite drinks.  If they are new to the bar, they will create a guest account so they can begin saving their favorites. 

A guest can create a new drink from a list of ingredients, by searching by name or from a list of either recently made drinks or the guest's previously saved favorites.  Once the selection has been made, the program will retrieve the details and present them to the guest, showing them how to create this drink.  The guest will then be given the option to save this drink to their favorites and asked if they would like to make another drink.   

If the guest is done, the option is presented for another guest to belly up to the bar and create their cocktail of choice.  Each guest will have their own favorites available to choose from as well as a list of recently made drinks - in case they want to try what the guest before them made!   

In addition to the options previously mentioned, each guest also has the option of creating their own drinks.  Once created, the drink details will be presented for the guest and they will be given the option to add to their favorites.  It will also remain in the recently made drinks for additional users to try if they would like! 

Once all guests have completed their drinking for the night, the exit prompts will advise the guest that all favorites will be lost when they leave the bar. 

  

Usage 

Follow the prompts throughout your time at the bar.  Be sure to remember once you leave the bar, your favorites will be lost.
